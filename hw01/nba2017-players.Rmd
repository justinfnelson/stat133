## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this

```{r}
# load data file
load("data/nba2017-salary-points.RData")
# list the available objects
ls()



salary_millions <- round(salary / 1000000, digits = 2)

experience <- gsub("R", 0, experience)
experience <- as.integer(experience)
class(experience)

position <- as.factor(position)
class(position)
library(plyr)
position <- revalue(position, c("C" = "center", "SF" = "small_fwd", "PF" = "power_fd", "SG" = "shoot_guard", "PG" = "shoot_guard"))
position
table(position)
salary
plot(points, salary_millions, main = "Scatter Plot of Points vs Salary", xlab = "Points", ylab = "Salary (in Millions)")

num_individuals <- length(player)
points_mean <- sum(points) / num_individuals
salary_mean <- sum(salary) / num_individuals

points_var <-(1 / (num_individuals - 1)) * sum((points - points_mean) ** 2)


salary_var <-(1 / (num_individuals - 1)) * sum((salary - salary_mean) ** 2)

points_sd <- sqrt(points_var)
salary_sd <- sqrt(salary_var)

cov <- (1 / (num_individuals - 1)) * (sum
                                      
                                      
(points - points_mean)
(salary - salary_mean)
```
